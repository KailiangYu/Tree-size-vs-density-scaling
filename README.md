# Tree-size-vs-density-scaling

This repository is generated for the project ‘Forest demography and biomass accumulation rates are associated with transient mean tree size vs density scaling relations’.

The files include: 1) Data of mean size vs density scaling trajectories (slopes) and the underlying environmental and biological variables in each forest stand. The raw inventory data are available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author. 2) Codes of generating figures in main text.
